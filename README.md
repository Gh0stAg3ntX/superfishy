what?
=====

Lenovo delivered Laptops with a preinstalled Adware called Superfish in 2014.
Superfish created a severe security hole in all affected devices. Later it
turned out that several other Internet filtering products were affected by the
same issue.

The software installs a root certificate into the browser which allows
Man-in-the-Middle-attacks.

I am collecting all the software, the extracted certificates and private keys
to make sure they stay available.

Sticking this here, hanno, as it's terrifically useful for those of us doing binary analysis on this project (well, those of us who aren't smart enough to use the real tools, eh?):
